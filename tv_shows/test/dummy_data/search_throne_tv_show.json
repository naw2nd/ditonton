After migrating from the far west of Desht-i-Kipchak to Mogolistan in Zhetysu, they revive their ancient shanyrak Ak Orda, the Kazakh Khanate. The first khan elected a direct descendant of Jochi and Urus Khan, Sultan Kerey. Here it is, the promised land when you can live peacefully and freely. But the enemies are trying to strangle the fragile Kazakh khanate even in the cradle and bloody battles, severe trials, the bitterness of losses and the joy of victories await them.",
